• You may use any development environment you wish, as long as it is ANSI C++ compatible. Please make
sure your code compiles and runs properly under the Linux/Unix environment on the PHO 305/307 (or
eng-grid) machines before submitting.
• PAs may be submitted up to a week late at the cost of a 30% fixed penalty (e.g., submitting a day late
and a week late is equivalent). It is in your best interest to complete as many PA questions as possible
before the deadline. If you have missing questions in your original submission, you may complete and
submit the missing solutions during the following week. Any submissions after the deadline will be
subject to the 30% penalty. No credit will be given to solutions submitted after the 1-week late
submission period following the deadline.
• Follow the assignment submission guidelines in this document or you will lose points.
Submission Format (Please Read)

- For revisions and late assignments please append “Late” to the name of the file.
- Please do NOT submit *.exe and *.o or any other files that are not required by the problem.
- Comment your code (good practice and required for partial credit!)
- GitHub submission instructions detailed in a separate document.
