/*
Start by writing the Point2D and Vector2D classes and a couple of their functions. Add the additional functions one at a time and test each one. Write a TestCheckpoint1.cpp file with a main function to test them. There, create multiple Point2D and Vector2D objects in order to test their constructors and overloaded operators (<<, +, -, *, /). Getting the overloaded output operator to work soon will make testing the remaining functions more fun. Create GameObject and instantiate a few cases in your main function and run the ShowStatus() function. Convince yourself that the objects have been created correctly and that their member variables have the right values.
