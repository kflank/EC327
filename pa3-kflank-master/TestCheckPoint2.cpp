Write the Building, ClassRoom and DoctorsOffice classes. To test these classes, also write a TestCheckpoint2.cpp. Instantiate multiple objects of these classes in the main function and test out their functions (e.g. Update(), DistributeVaccine(), AddOneStudent(), etc.) in order to ensure their proper behavior. For example, call each objectâ€™s ShowStatus() method after calling their Update() method.
